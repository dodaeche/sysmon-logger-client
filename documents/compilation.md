# Compilation

The client/project has been developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. The application is written in the C# language.

The Microsoft Framework version used was 4.6.1. The only external package used was the [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent) library. The **TraceEvent** library was used to hook into the Windows Event system.
